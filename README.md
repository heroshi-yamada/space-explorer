## ğŸŒ  Why Space? (Inspiration)  

One night, while staring at my ceiling, I realized:  
- My code had more bugs than the International Space Station  
- My social life was as empty as a vacuum  
- I'd watched *The Martian* 17 times  

Thus, Space Explorer was born - so I could explore the universe while avoiding my earthly problems. Special thanks to:  
- Carl Sagan's *Cosmos* for the inspiration  
- NASA's open APIs for the data  
- My cat for walking on my keyboard and "helping" with the code
